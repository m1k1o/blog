# blog
This is a simple self-hosted, lightweight, singe-user PHP blog, where you can create your own Facebook-like feed. Give read access to other people, and you can share rich text with photos including highlighted code or links.

In this context lightweight means:
* No npm dependency, there won't be an annoying 1GB `node_modules` directory.
* No pipeline. What you see is pure code without a need to install it.
* No overhead, essential features, simple usage.

## Zero configuration setup
Container will run without any initial configuration needed using SQLite as database provider. For better performance consider using MySQL.

```sh
docker run -d -p 80:80 -v $PWD/data:/var/www/html/data m1k1o/blog:latest
```

You can set environment variables, prefixed with `BLOG_` and uppercase. They can be found in `config.ini`.
```sh
docker run -d \
  -p 80:80 \
  -e "TZ=Europe/Vienna" \
  -e "BLOG_TITLE=Blog" \
  -e "BLOG_NAME=Max Musermann" \
  -e "BLOG_NICK=username" \
  -e "BLOG_PASS=password" \
  -e "BLOG_LANG=en" \
  -v $PWD/data:/var/www/html/data \
  m1k1o/blog:latest
```

Or for docker-compose format, see [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml).

## Install standalone app using `docker-compose` with external database
You need to install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### MySQL
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  webserver:
    image: m1k1o/blog:latest
    container_name: blog_apache
    environment:
      TZ: Europe/Vienna
      BLOG_DB_CONNECTION: mysql
      BLOG_MYSQL_HOST: mariadb
      BLOG_MYSQL_PORT: 3306
      BLOG_MYSQL_USER: blog
      BLOG_MYSQL_PASS: blog # use secure password
      BLOG_DB_NAME: blog
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - ${HTTP_PORT-80}:80
    volumes: 
      - ${DATA-./data}:/var/www/html/data
  mariadb:
    image: mariadb:10.1
    container_name: blog_mariadb
    environment:
      MYSQL_USER: blog
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: blog # use secure password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: blog
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root # use secure password
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - mariadb:/var/lib/mysql
      - ./app/db/mysql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d:ro
volumes:
  mariadb:
```

### Postgres
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  webserver:
    image: m1k1o/blog:latest
    container_name: blog_apache
    environment:
      TZ: Europe/Vienna
      BLOG_DB_CONNECTION: postgres
      BLOG_POSTGRES_HOST: postgres
      BLOG_POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
      BLOG_POSTGRES_USER: blog
      BLOG_POSTGRES_PASS: blog # use secure password
      BLOG_DB_NAME: blog
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - ${HTTP_PORT-80}:80
    volumes: 
      - ${DATA-./data}:/var/www/html/data
  postgres:
    image: postgres:14
    container_name: blog_postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: blog
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: blog # use secure password
      POSTGRES_DB: blog
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      - ./app/db/postgres:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d:ro
volumes:
  postgres:
```

### Step 1: Run `docker-compose.yml`.
Select one of configurations above and save it to `docker-compose.yml`. Then run:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

You can specify these environment variables, otherwise the default ones will be used:
* **HTTP_PORT=80** - where the blog will be accessible.
* **DATA=./data** - directory to store the user data.

These environment variables can be stored in the `.env` file or passed to the command directly:
```sh
HTTP_PORT=3001 DATA=/home/user/blog docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 2: Create `data/` directory and download `config.ini` file.
Download default config file and copy to your new `./data/` directory.

```sh
mkdir data && cd data
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m1k1o/blog/master/config.ini
```

Now you can modify your config. Or you can set environment variables, in uppercase, starting with `BLOG_`, e.g. `BLOG_NAME: Max's blog`.

### Correct permissions
Make sure your `./data/` directory has correct permissions. Apache is running as a `www-data` user, which needs to have write access to the `./data/` directory (for uploading images).

#### Prefered solution
Change the directory owner to the `www-data` user:

```sh
chown 33:33 ./data/
```

Alternatively, add the `www-data` user to the user group that owns the `./data/` directory.

#### Bad solution (but it works)
Set `777` permission for your `./data/`, so everyone can read, write, and execute:

```sh
chmod 777 ./data/
```

**NOTICE:** You should not use `777`. You are giving access to anyone for this directory. Maybe to some attacker, who can run his exploit here.

## Install
If you have decided that you don't want to use Docker, you can intall it manually.

**Requirements:** Apache 2.0*, PHP 7.4, (MariaDB 10.1 or SQLite 3)

**NOTICE:** If you would like to use Nginx or another web server, make sure that the sensitive data are not exposed to the public. Since `.htaccess` is protecting those files in Apache, that could not be the case in a different environment. Take care of:
* **config.ini** - disallow access to all *.ini* files for the public.
* **data/logs/\_ANY_.log** - make sure no sensitive information are located in *.log*.

### Database Schema
You can find database schema in `./app/db` folder.

### Debug mode
To check if your server is set up correctly, turn on a debug mode (in config add `debug = true`) to see the details. In the debug mode, an error may be shown if you are missing some **PHP extensions** needed to be installed on your server.

## Config file
**DO NOT** edit `./config.ini` file. If you wish to modify the config, simply make a copy to the `./data/config.ini` directory and edit it there.

**But, why?** If there is any change in config file (most likely adding a new feature), you will have problems with merging a new version. Also, if you would fork this repository, you might accidentally push your secrets to the git. We don't want that to happen. Content of the `/data` directory is ignored by the git, so none of your pictures or personal data should ever be published to git.

## Access control

This blog is using Mandatory Access Control (MAC), with 3 types of access levels:

* **Private** posts are visible only to your single account specified in `nick` and `pass`.
* You can specify group of your **friends** and share posts only for them.
* **Public** posts are visible to everyone, without login.

In `docker-compose.yml` file, specify your credentials and friends like this:

```yml
version: "3"
services:
  blog:
    image: m1k1o/blog:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
        TZ: Europe/Vienna
        BLOG_NICK: admin_username
        BLOG_PASS: admin_password
        BLOG_FRIENDS: |
          jane:mysecretpass
          thomas:anotherpass
    ports:
      - 80:80
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/www/html/data
```

You can specify your credentials and friends in your `config.ini` file e.g.:

```ini
[admin]
force_login = true
nick = admin_username
pass = admin_password

[friends] 
friends[jane] = mysecretpass
friends[thomas] = anotherpass
```

## Localisation
Timezone can be set in config or, for docker users, `TZ` environment variable is supported. List of timezones can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
